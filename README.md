# Factorial

This repository contains the factorial(n) function coded with a number of different
algorithms/implementations in various languages. The purpose is not to provide Factorial as a Service
(FaaS), but it to investigate data-driven testing in the various languages.

## See Also

Rosetta Code is possibly the premier location of examples of coding. For Factorial see
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Factorial They are concerned only with the code of the algorithm, the point of
this repository is as much the tests as the algorithms.
